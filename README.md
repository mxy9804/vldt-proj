# The *Visible Lighter Data Transfer* (VLDT) Project

## Brief
*Visible Lighter Data Transfer* (Proj. No. 1) Project, run by Group 29 of Dr. Huang Wei's *Computer Network* course, Class 2, is in the charge of Han Li and other 3 group mates, of the University of Xiamen. 

This project aims at developing a way through which binary files or plain texts could be smoothly transfered between two devices through visible lights produced by either of which. The project contains some key parts of the current *Computer Network* course, such as --
*  Data reading and encoding;
*  Translate between data files and transferrable binaries; and
*  Modulate and demodulate.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help realise the fundamental methods of the physical level of a network, which constitute the base of the OSI (Open System Interconnect) Reference Model, and therefore develop knowledge of the basic formation of modern computer networks.

## References
In addition, the image pattern that is used in the transferring part is widely *drawn on the experience of* the [JabCode](https://github.com/jabcode/jabcode) project made by Fraunhofer SIT in Germany, whose technical specification could be found [here](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/TechnicalGuidelines/TR03137/BSITR03137.html).

## More information
This project **starts on 16/02/2020 (SUN)**, and is expected to finish by 31/03/2020 (SUN). This repository contains all source files of this project, and executables which have all been successfully compiled and tested on Windows 7 and macOS 10.14 Mojave.
